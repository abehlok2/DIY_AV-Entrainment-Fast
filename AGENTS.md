Modify and work on EXCLUSIVELY the cpp_audio portion of the codebase 

DO NOT modify any python files. ONLY use them as a reference for correctly and thoroughly implementing the features contained within into the cpp_audio version of the codebase 

The entry point for the GUI application is the main.cpp file in src/cpp_audio. 

The GUI files for the GUI application exist in src/cpp_audio/ui
GUI files must be integrated into main.cpp

The synth functions that are used to generate the audio itself are in the src/cpp_audio/synths directory 

Models go into the src/cpp_audio/models directory 

---

MORE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:

Focus now entirely on implementing the Real-Time Generation backend as described by the implementation plan that can be viewed in "cpp_audio/REALTIME_BACKEND_PLAN.MD"

update the plan file with changes as they are implemented. Update this documentation as a TODO to achieve the final goal. 

This will compile SEPARATELY from the AudioApp GUI program. 

And function entirely in it's backend / realtime audio / web-integratable form.
